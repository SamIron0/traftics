# Installation Guide

You're just a few steps from using Traftics on your website! To start collecting user data and recording user sessions, you have to deploy your code.

## Deploying your tracking code:

    1. You can find your tracking code in your Project settings.
    2. Add the tracking code to your website. An example of a tracking code:

```js filename="demo.js" {3} copy
    <script>
    (function(d, w) {
        w._r = w._r || {
        websiteId: "${websiteId}"
        };
        var s = d.createElement('script');
        s.async = true;
        s.src = 'https://493117db.traftics-tracker.pages.dev/tracker.js';
        d.head.appendChild(s);
    })(document, window);
    </script>
```

And you're all set!

Once deployed on your website, user sessions start to show up in your Traftics project. Allow a few minutes for the tracking code to be processed by Traftics. Your first user sessions Sessions are fully available shortly after a user visits visits your website.
